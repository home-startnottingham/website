        <p class="boxededPara"><em class="italic">“As a former Social Worker and current campaigner against austerity and for the NHS, Home-Start seemed like a good fit for me! I’m all too aware how difficult it is to be a parent and it’s great to work in an organisation committed to supporting people who really need a helping hand..”....Mike, ex-Chair of Trustees</em></p>
        <p>Do you want to support your local community whilst developing your skillset in the workplace? We are looking for additional Trustees to join our Trustee Board.</p>
        <p>The Board of Trustees takes overall responsibility for the charity, setting its strategic direction and employing its staff.</p>
        <p class="boxededPara"><em class="italic">“I wanted to be involved in Home-Start as it provides an invaluable and unique service in supporting families which can have a life-long impact.   I had recently left Citizens Advice after 15 years in a managerial role and I thought this and previous experience would be helpful to the trustee board” ... Clare, Trustee</em></p>
        <p>We meet monthly as a Board and there are also various sub-committees that meet as necessary.</p>

        <p class="boxededPara"><em class="italic">“As I began to wind down from full time employment, I was put in contact with Home-Start regarding a vacant Trustee Treasurer position by a friend who was in both my work and social network.  The objectives of the charity hit my personal sweet spot.  All the people I met at various interviews and subsequently since appointment have been welcoming, helpful, understanding and extremely positive.  It has so far proved highly rewarding emotionally to see everyone working in the same direction in order to achieve positive outcomes for both parents and their young children” ... Bob, Treasurer</em></p>
        <p>We have vacancies for trustees to serve on our board, taking responsibility for directing the management and administration of the organisation. It is a fantastic opportunity to support us whilst also developing your skillset in the workplace.</p>
