        <p>Home-Start Nottingham began in 1978 and is now one of over 180 schemes across the UK and 24 countries worldwide.</p>
        <p>Although part of a national organisation, Home-Start Nottingham is firmly rooted in the local community, managed by a committee made up of individuals with specialist skills.</p>
        <p>Home-Start UK provides valuable guidance around policy, training, information and personal support, enabling us to respond to local needs, but having the quality of service derived from agreed national quality standards.</p>
        <p>We are locally driven, managed and supported by local volunteers, in this way, the service helps to reconnect and reintegrate families with their community. Children, parents and the wider community all benefit from our work.</p>
        <p>Home-Start Nottingham provides a universal and non-stigmatising service and is therefore sometimes more acceptable to families than statutory services, because a volunteer chooses to visit a family it helps them to feel valued and has an effect on their self-esteem.</p>
        <p>Our volunteers support families in a sensitive and flexible way. They share their time, friendship and work alongside parents focusing on their strengths and offering families the opportunity to develop new relationships, ideas and skills.</p>
